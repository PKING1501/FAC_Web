## TAXONOMICS UNVEILED:  
### JOURNEY THROUGH INDIA'S TAXATION SYSTEM

---

### INTRODUCTION
The Indian Tax structure is a **three-tier** system controlled by the Union government, the State government, and local bodies. Taxation in India is divided into two types:

- **Direct Tax**
- **Indirect Tax**

### DIRECT TAX
Direct taxes are imposed on corporate entities and individuals. These taxes **cannot** be transferred to others.

#### TYPES OF DIRECT TAX:
- **Income Tax**: Applies to any income of an individual and HUF except capital gains and profits from business and profession.
- **Capital Gains Tax**: Applies to profits from the sale of a capital asset only.
- **Corporate Tax**: Applies to businesses and entities filing their returns as a company.

---

### INDIRECT TAX
Indirect taxes are taxes imposed by the government on goods and services rather than directly on individuals or businesses.

Some indirect taxes like VAT (Value-Added Tax) and service tax have been replaced by the Goods and Services Tax (GST).

### GOVERNMENT REVENUE SOURCES (Indirect Tax Breakdown)

- Excise Duty: **41%**
- Corporation Tax: **6%**
- Custom Duty: **14%**
- Other: **14%**
- Income Tax: **26%**

### INCOME TAX
1. Income tax refers to the levy imposed by a government on an individual's or a corporation's earnings or income.
2. It is calculated by determining gross income and subtracting applicable deductions and exemptions to arrive at **taxable income**.
3. Tax rates are then applied based on specific brackets, resulting in the final tax liability or refund.

### GOODS AND SERVICES TAX (GST)
GST is an indirect tax levied on the supply of goods and services. It replaces multiple layers of taxes such as excise duty, service tax, value-added tax (VAT), and others with a unified tax regime.

#### KEY FEATURES:
- **One Tax, One Nation**
- **Threshold for Registration**
- **Input Tax Credit**
- **Compliance and Technology**
- **Tax Slabs**

### HINDU UNDIVIDED FAMILY (HUF) ACT
A Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) is a unique form of business organization in India, recognized under the Hindu Succession Act, 1956.

#### KEY FEATURES:
- **Common Ancestral Property**: An HUF typically owns and manages ancestral property passed down through generations, and all members of the HUF have a share in it.
- **Tax Benefits**: HUFs receive separate tax exemptions and deductions for their income.
- **Partition**: An HUF can be partitioned at any time by its members.
- **Karta**: The HUF is headed by the eldest male member, known as the "Karta."

This comprehensive look at India's taxation system reflects the complexity and layers that exist in the structure. Both **direct** and **indirect taxes** play pivotal roles in generating revenue for the government and shaping the nation's economic framework.
